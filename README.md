## with UM980 GNSS Module & Raspberry Pi Zero 2WH

RTKit is a simple, affordable project for building your own GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) basestation using a Raspberry Pi Zero and UM980 board. It's ideal for RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) applications like precision surveying or navigation. This guide focuses on hardware assembly; software setup (e.g., using RTKLIB) is left to the user.

<br>

- Enclosure/Case (user's choice—see optional section below)

# To complete your setup, you will need the following components:

- GNSS Antenna  Recommend: Beitian BS-800S<br>
Example: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808846936564.html
<img width="450" height="200" alt="antenna" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d12811f0-edee-4f7d-b358-3e0ba1650b81" />

- LM400 cable SMA - TNC<br>
Example: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808997745754.html <br>
Connector Compatibility Note: <br>
The antenna requires a TNC-K connector — not a standard TNC.
Why this matters:
Standard TNC and TNC-K have different sizes.
Recommended Practice:
To guarantee compatibility, buy the antenna and cable as a bundle from the same supplier.

## 🚀 Installation Guide

### Prerequisites:

- A computer for initial SD card flashing.
- Internet access for downloads and configuration.



## Optional: Enclosures and 3D Printing
You can choose any suitable enclosure for your basestation—off-the-shelf waterproof cases work great for outdoor use. For a custom fit, 3D-printable files are available in the [print_files](print_files) folder as an optional starting point. Feel free to modify or design your own!

Here's an example of various enclosure options to inspire you:  
<img width="1000" height="275" alt="coll" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96d59010-52d4-4a1a-acc0-da424a6dbc85" />


*(Image shows a range of colorful, rugged cases suitable for electronics projects.)*

If you decide to 3D print a case using the provided files:  
- **Recommended Materials**: PETG, ASA, or PLA+ for durability.  
- **Orientation**: Print flat (bottom side down) for best results.  
- **Supports**: Not required.  
- **Infill**: 20-40% is typically sufficient.  

No 3D printer? Services like [Craftcloud3D](https://craftcloud3d.com/) can print and ship custom parts for you.

### 2. Assemble the Main Board

### 1. Flash the OS
Download and flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)** in the **Debian Bookworm** version to your microSD card using Raspberry Pi Imager. Enable SSH and Wi-Fi before proceeding. For more detailed information on flashing and setup, please refer to: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-the-operating-system.

### 2. Connect via SSH
Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it up.  
Then connect using an SSH client like **PuTTY**:


### 3. Update and Reboot

Run the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo reboot
```



### 5. Install the ELT_RTKBase Software

Open a terminal (ssh with putty) on the Pi and run **two** times:
```bash
wget https://github.com/GNSSOEM/ELT_RTKBase/raw/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
The script will install the required software and drivers, and start the dashboard (usually accessible at http://raspberrypi.local).

💡 After installation, you can connect it to onocoy directly from the web dashboard.
