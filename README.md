# To complete your setup, you will need the following components:

- GNSS Antenna  Recommend: Beitian BS-800S
Example: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808846936564.html
<img width="450" height="200" alt="antenna" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d12811f0-edee-4f7d-b358-3e0ba1650b81" />

- LM400 cable SMA - TNC
Example: https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808997745754.html
Connector Compatibility Note:
The antenna requires a TNC-K connector ‚Äî not a standard TNC.
Why this matters:
Standard TNC and TNC-K have different sizes.
Recommended Practice:
To guarantee compatibility, buy the antenna and cable as a bundle from the same supplier.

## üöÄ Installation Guide

### Prerequisites:

- A computer for initial SD card flashing.
- Internet access for downloads and configuration.
- You can 3D print the case yourself from the provided STL files, utilize a 3D printing service, or purchase a pre-printed case if available.



### 1. Print the Case

### 2. Assemble the Main Board
![main_board](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd724068-8737-407b-b39b-44f12837400d)


(The photo shows the 2W version with pins added by the user)

- Assemble the Ethernet Hub and Raspberry Pi Zero: Carefully connect the Ethernet hub and the Raspberry Pi Zero, referring to their respective manuals for detailed instructions.
- Attach the USB-A to USB-C OTG Adapter: Insert the USB-A to USB-C OTG adapter into the designated port on the right side of the Raspberry Pi Zero.
- Connect the UM980 GNSS Board: Attach the UM980 GNSS board to the USB-C OTG adapter.
- Mount the Assembled Board: Carefully place the fully assembled board into the case.
- Secure the Board: Use the provided screws to fix the board firmly to the case.
- Install the Antenna Plug: Guide the antenna plug through the designated hole in the case and secure it by screwing it into place.
- Attach the Fans: Slide the two fans into their designated slots on the lid of the case.
- Connect the Fans: Connect the fan cables to the appropriate GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi Zero. ( https://github.com/airtkey/UM980-diy-/blob/main/pictures/raspberry-pi-zero-pinout.png )

### 1. Flash the OS
Download and flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)** in the **Debian Bookworm** version to your microSD card using Raspberry Pi Imager. Enable SSH and Wi-Fi before proceeding. For more detailed information on flashing and setup, please refer to: https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#installing-the-operating-system.

### 2. Connect via SSH
Insert the SD card into your Raspberry Pi and power it up.  
Then connect using an SSH client like **PuTTY**:


### 3. Update and Reboot

Run the following commands:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo reboot



   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/GNSSOEM/ELT_RTKBase/raw/main/install.sh
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh


### 5. Install the ELT_RTKBase Software

Open a terminal (ssh with putty) on the Pi and run two times:

"wget https://github.com/GNSSOEM/ELT_RTKBase/raw/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.shlol

The script will install the required software and drivers, and start the dashboard (usually accessible at http://raspberrypi.local:3000).

üí° After installation, you can configure your receiver and connect it to a network like Onocoy directly from the web dashboard.

## üñ®Ô∏è Print Instructions

- File format: `.stl`
- Recommended material: **PETG** or **PLA+**
- Orientation: print flat (bottom side down)
- Supports: **not required**
- Infill: 15‚Äì30%

## üß∞ Assembly

1. Place the UM980 module inside the case.
2. Mount the **3010 fan** above the chip ‚Äì connect power directly to the module pins *(or skip if using a passive heatsink)*.
3. Route the USB-C and antenna cables through the side cutouts.
4. Close the lid ‚Äì some variants support screw or snap-fit.

## üîÄ Splitter Variant

The "Splitter" case version has space to install a **GNSS splitter**, allowing you to run the UM980 module **in parallel with another GNSS miner** (e.g. for multimining with Geodnet + Onocoy).

> üõ†Ô∏è Important: Be sure to use an **active splitter** with power passthrough if your antenna needs voltage.
