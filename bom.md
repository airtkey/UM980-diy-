##### Component Summary Table
| Component | Description (from README) | Quantity | Est. Price (USD) | Recommended Sources | Notes/Alternatives |
|-----------|---------------------------|----------|------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Raspberry Pi Zero 2 WH** | Core for GNSS data processing. | 1 | $15–$20 | - Official: [Raspberry Pi Store](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) (reliable, direct).<br>- Amazon: [Search: Pi Zero 2 WH](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=raspberry+pi+zero+2+wh) (~$25, fast shipping).<br>- AliExpress: [Pi Zero 2 WH](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-raspberry-pi-zero-2w-h.html) (~$12–$15, budget-friendly). | Ensure "H" variant (headers included). Alternative: Pi Zero W if headers can be soldered. |
| **Ethernet / USB HUB HAT** | Ethernat and USB hat | 1 | $15–$20 | - Official: [waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/hats/interface-power/eth-usb-hub-hat-b.htm?___SID=U)<br>- Available from local electronics stores, Amazon, or AliExpress. | Ensure Pogo pin design. |
| **UM980 GNSS Module** | Multi-constellation RTK-capable module (UART/USB output for RTCM/NMEA). Key for basestation corrections; connect via UART as detailed in README. | 1 | $90 - $130 | - AliExpress (Caution: most retailers ship different qualities.).<br>- [Witmotion](https://witmotion-sensor.com/)<br>- [gns-electronics](https://www.gns-electronics.de/) |Select the small board, as shown in the pictures in the readme file.
| **USB-A (Male) to USB-C (Male) OTG** | | 1 | $3–$10 | - Available from local electronics stores, Amazon, or AliExpress. | Ensure same format as on the picture |
| **GNSS Antenna** | Multi-band mushroom head antenna. | 1| $100 | - [Beitian](https://store.beitian.com/collections/best-selling/products/beitian-high-gain-high-precision-gnss-antenna-provide-stability-and-reliability-gnss-signal-for-positioning-applications-bt-800s?variant=44374047490335)<br>- AliExpress: [RTK GNSS Antenna](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-rtk-gps-antenna.html)| often involved: magnetic mount for placement. **Important Note:** The quality of the GNSS antenna is a critical factor for achieving high data accuracy in RTKit. Opt for a multi-band (L1/L2) active antenna like the recommended BS-800S to ensure reliable signal reception and minimal multipath interference—poor choices can reduce RTK fix quality.  |
| **MicroSD Card** | 8GB+ | 1 | $5–$8 | - Available from local electronics stores, Amazon, or AliExpress (prioritize verified sellers for quality) | Class 10 for reliability. |
| **Fan 30x30x08 5V/3V** | | 2 | $3–$10 | - Available from local electronics stores, Amazon, or AliExpress. | |
| **RF cable SMA - TNC** | | 1 | <$20 | - Available from local electronics stores, Amazon, or [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256808997745754.html). |Compatibility Note: The antenna requires a TNC-K connector — not a standard TNC. Why this matters: Standard TNC and TNC-K have different sizes. Recommended Practice: To guarantee compatibility, buy the antenna and cable as a bundle from the same supplier. |
| **Power Supply & Wires** | 5V/ micro-USB for Pi | 1 set | $10–$20 | - Available from local electronics stores, Amazon, or AliExpress. | Use the official Raspberry Pi power supply (5V/2A micro-USB). Avoid generic phone chargers, as they may cause instability or undervoltage issues. |
| **Enclosure** | Custom 3D-printed case from `print_files/` folder (README references for weatherproofing). | 1 | $5–$15 | - 3D Services: [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/) or [Treatstock](https://www.treatstock.com/) (~$10–$15, upload STL). | Use ASA, PLA+ or PETG.  |
